GIT:- version control system

0. install git
1. initialize a git repo
2. configure files to track
3. git tracks changes   --> you can configure all the files to track or specific files to track.
4. stage changes
5. commit changes
 
git version
git init
git status
git add file1 file2 file3 ... etc
git status
modify / add any file
git status
git add main.py  --> this time it stages the changes and marks them ready for commit
git status
git commit -m "Initial Commit" --->> use a commit message for reference after -m option.

once commited git creates a new version of repository.

local repo -> laptop

remote repo - > this can be anywhre in the internet or local network.

what is thie remote repo:- github or gitlab  --> they are popular

difference between git and github:- git is the tool and github is the git server that hosts repositories in internet.

you must create a repository. If you are using github, then create a new repository using github web ui.
After creation make it public or private.
Then take the url of the repository.
Then add this url to the local system using the below command.

git remote add <name> <url>   --> name is for reference. It can be anything.
git remote add github https://github.com/mmumshad/my-application.git
git push <name> <branch>
git push github master

Note:- the default branch is master.

If you are pushing it for first time, and the master branch is not present on the remote side, then you must use -u option as below.
git push -u github master

Others can get it as --

git clone https://github.com/mmumshad/my-application.git    --> for the one who doesn't have this repository in local. Like other users.
once cloned, no need to configure the git repo. It will automatically get configured and can be checked with the below command.

git remote -v

origin is the default name to the remote repository when it is cloned.

git pull --> this is the command to pull the changes and not the complete repository.

Another try with kodekloud youtube video:-

GIT:-

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr7sYCrhxE0

SCM:- source control management

VCS:- Version Control System - there are many VCS and GIT is one of the most popular one.

staging area:- the place where the files which are ready to be committed are placed.

when we commit, the changes will be created only with that file placed in the staging.


steps:-

install GIT
initialize a GIT repository
configure files to track
GIT tracks changes
stage changes
commit changes


install GIT:- yum install git / apt install git .... etc

instructions are here https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/getting-started-installing-git

git version

git init

git status

git add file1 file2 file3 ...   --> configure which files to be tracked by GIT

git status

change a file say main.py

git status   --> this will say that the file is changed but not staged.

git add main.py --> this command will stage this file.

git commit -m "Initial Commit"      --> -m is for message like "Initial Commit"

once committed, GIT creates a new version of the changes. If we do not specify the message using -m, git will open a editor and ask to type the message.



local git repository :- laptop / computer


remote git repository:- anywhere in the internet / network

so all the users can work on local repository and push to the remote repository.

if multiple users modifying the same file, git most likely handle this situation.

but if multiple users modifying the same file and the same line, then merge conflict arises. 

then you have to tell git which change is to be accepted.


what is this and how do you set one up. remote git repository can be hosted on a git server. identify a system/server in your network and install git on it. the way you install in your laptop. GIT comes with a built in command called git daemon that runs git as a simple tcp server. that's all you really need to built a git server.


alternate way is to publicly hosted services like github or gitlab. the are free.

what is the difference between git and github

commands:-

git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"

reate a repository in github ( the plus/+ sign on the top right )
then copy the url

next step is to transfer the code from local repository to the remote repository there in github.

our local repository must know that we have a remote repository. 

for that we have to run the command as ..

git remote add <name> <the url>

note:- the name does not have to be the same name as our own remote repository. It is only for our reference.

we can have the same local repository pushed to multiple remote repository. So, we must konw which repository is for which purpose.

now push the code to the remore repository.

git push <name> <branch-name>


for now just consider the default branch is the "master".

as the master branch is not there in the remote repository yet as it is just created. You must specify that with -u option as below.

git push -u github master

next onwards as the master is already there, then -u is not needed.

now master is available in the remote repository. How other users can retrieve it?

for that the code has to be pulled in the local laptop. The command as --

for the first time, we must clone the repository.

git clone https://xxxxx.yyyy.zzzz

as the user is cloned the repository, he doesn't need to configure the remote. The remote is altumatically configured for him.

running the below command will list the remote repositories.

git remote -v

note:- origin is the defalt name to the remote repository when it is cloned. It is short form of Original (origin) repository.

another user, can get the new changes by pulling them. for this the user need to run the below command.

git pull
